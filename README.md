Portuguese → Invented Language Translator (2013)
🗂️ Archival project from 2013, when I was 15 years old
This was one of my earliest experiments with PHP, databases, and JavaScript.
📖 Story
Back in 2013, when I was 15, I decided to create a "translator" that would convert Portuguese into a fictional language I invented.
I didn’t know much about programming at the time, but I was fascinated by the idea of making the computer manipulate text. This project became my first full PHP application: a simple, playful tool that could take user input, replace words with equivalents from my made-up language, and display the result in the browser.
Even though it’s technically very simple, it represents an important milestone in my coding journey — the point where I realized programming could turn ideas (even quirky ones) into something interactive.
⚙️ How it works
Database of words
I created a small database that mapped Portuguese words to equivalents in my invented language.
Example:
casa → xalan
amigo → terva
comer → olvak
PHP word replacement
The PHP script took user-submitted text and scanned it word by word.
Using str_replace, it replaced each Portuguese word with its "translation."
jQuery interactivity
I added a simple interface with jQuery to submit text and display the result without reloading the page.
That’s it — no frameworks, no complex logic, just string replacement and a touch of interactivity.
💡 Why I keep it here
This project is not meant to showcase professional-level PHP skills — it’s an archive piece.
I include it here because it:
Shows where my programming journey started.
Demonstrates curiosity, creativity, and experimentation at an early stage.
Reminds me of how far I’ve come in terms of coding practices and knowledge.

🕹️ Try it?
Since this was built in 2013, you’ll need:
PHP (any version supporting str_replace)
A simple MySQL/MariaDB database with word mappings
Run the project locally, input some Portuguese text, and watch it get transformed into my invented language.
